<p>Title: Fractals in the Complex Plane</p>
<p>Ever since the term was introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot">Benoit B. Mandelbrot</a>, &quot;fractals&quot; have awed so many people with their odd combination of simplicity and complexity. In this article I specifically talk about fractals in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane">complex plane</a>, but fractal geometry and its derivatives are a fascinating part of math going much beyond what I detail here, so definitely get yourself interested in that.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let's figure out exactly what a <strong>fractal</strong> is. Dictionary.com defines the word fractal to mean "<i>a geometrical or physical structure having an irregular or fragmented shape at all scales of measurement between a greatest and smallest scale such that certain mathematical or physical properties of the structure, as the perimeter of a curve or the flow rate in a porous medium, behave as if the dimensions of the structure (fractal dimensions) are greater than the spatial dimensions.</i>" This is quite wordy, sure, but to get a better idea of what a fractal is, let's look at some examples.</p>
<p>Below is the Mandelbrot set - arguably one of the most famous fractals in existence - named after our old friend Benoit B. Mandelbrot, the father of fractal geometry.</p>

<p>Sure, this fractal is quite pleasing to look at. But as with any object, without some deeper meaning, a lot of beauty is lost. Let's delve into how the Mandelbrot set is generated.</p>
<p>First, let's consider the name. The Mandelbrot set is really just that: a <strong>set</strong>. That means it's effectively a list of points. When we color these points black and the rest of the points white, we get the figure from above. But how is this set determined?</p>
<p>To understand the construction of the Mandelbrot set, we need to know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number">complex numbers</a>. Complex numbers, of course, are an incredibly rich subject, and they have applications in physics, statistics, and much more. In essence, complex numbers are based off an "imaginary number" called <i>i</i>, defined so that \(i^2=-1\). Imaginary numbers can be added and multiplied together, and when they are combined with a real component, they are called complex numbers. Let's see some basic complex arithmetic in action.</p>
<p>Like any other number, the conventional rules for arithmetic addition and subtraction work with <i>i</i>. For example, \(2i+2i=4i\) and \(5i-2i=3i\).</p>
<p>By the definition of <i>i</i>, we know that \(i^2=-1\). But what's the value of, say, \((3i)^2\)? Well, we can treat this expression as \((3 \cdot i)^2 = 3^2 \cdot i^2\). Using our definition of <i>i</i>, we thus know that \((3i)^2=9\cdot-1=-9\).</p>
<p>How about complex numbers? Well, when we add them, we just add their real components and their imaginary components in turn. For example, \((2+3i)+(4+9i)=(2+4)+(3+9)i=6+12i\)  and  \((2+3i)-(4+9i)=(2-4)+(3-9)i=-2-6i\). Multiplication of complex numbers is a tad tricker, but we just use the distributive property. For example, \((2+3i)\cdot(4+9i)=8+18i+12i-27=-19+30i\).</p>
<p>We have these lovely complex numbers now. But is there a way to visualize them?</p>
<p>Sure thing! We can think of these complex numbers as <i>points</i> on a plane, sort of like a Cartesian coordinate system. The <i>number</i> \(a+bi\) corresponds to the <i>point</i> \((a,b)\) on the coordinate plane.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just a very basic introduction to complex numbers and the idea of the complex plane, so if you haven't learned about them yet and really want to understand what will be going on in the rest of this article, reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number">complex numbers</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane">complex plane</a> may be helpful.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let's figure out what the Mandelbrot set is about!</p>
<p>Define a function \(f_c(z)=z^2+c\) over the complex numbers. Then the Mandelbrot set is the set of all numbers \(c\) for which the function \(f_c(z)\) does not diverge when iterated from \(z=0\). In other words, \(f_c(f_c(f_c\cdots (z)))\) stays bounded.</p>
<p>Let's test if the number \(0.2+0.5i\) is in the Mandelbrot set. We start with \(f_c(0)\), where \(c=0.2+0.5i\). In the next iteration, we do \(f_c(0.2+0.5i)=-0.01 + 0.7i\), then in the next we do \(f_c(-0.01 + 0.7 i)\), etc. The results of these iterations are shown:</p>
<div style="width: 256px; margin:0 auto;">

            <figcaption><p align="center">Figure 2: The numbers produced by iteration of \(f_c\).</p></figcaption>
            </figure>
</div>
<br>
<p>It seems \(c=0.2+0.5\) does not diverge to infinity; it stays bounded. Thus, it is in the Mandelbrot set. Overlaying a point \(c=0.2+0.5i\) on the original image, we can see that, indeed, the point lies in a black region. (The point is red; the x and y axes are also indicated.)</p>
<div style="width:768px; margin:0 auto;">
    <figure>
        <img src="article1/mandelbrot2.png" alt="Mandelbrot Set  (Real axis: [-2.5,1.5], Imaginary axis: [-2,2], 500 iterations.)" width="768" height="525">
            <figcaption><p align="center">Figure 3: The Mandelbrot set, overlayed with point \(c=0.2+0.5i\).</p></figcaption>
            </figure>
</div>
<br>
<p>This repeated calculation is done for every point - or, at least, every pixel in the image - and if the calculation stays bounded to a reasonable number of iterations, we can assume that it probably will stay bounded forever. All the images up to this point have been done with 500 iterations, though much less are needed at this level of zoom.</p>
<p>But what's so interesting about the Mandelbrot set? The answer lies in its intrinsically fractal nature. For example, suppose we zoom in on the Mandelbrot set, say, on the gray rectangle highlighted here:</p>
<div style="width:768px; margin:0 auto;">
    <figure>
        <img src="article1/mandelbrot3.png" alt="Mandelbrot Set  (Real axis: [-2.5,1.5], Imaginary axis: [-2,2], 500 iterations.)" width="768" height="525">
            <figcaption><p align="center">Figure 4: The Mandelbrot set, box around mini-Brot.</p></figcaption>
            </figure>
</div>
<br>
<p>When we zoom in on that box, we get this image:</p>
<div style="width:768px; margin:0 auto;">
    <figure>
        <img src="article1/mandelbrot4.png" alt="Mandelbrot Set" width="768">
            <figcaption><p align="center">Figure 5: The Mandelbrot set, zoomed on mini-Brot at approximately \((-0.145,1.025)\).</p></figcaption>
            </figure>
</div>
<br>
<p>Wait... what? It's the Mandelbrot Set again! It's just rotated and scaled down. There must be some end to this... let's zoom in on the same spot, but now in this "mini-Brot".</p>

<p>The Mandelbrot set, of course is very popular and famous fractal, but many of its properties are still unknown, including its area.</p>
